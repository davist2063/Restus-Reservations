# Restus-Reservations
A software application to reserve vacation rooms

Brief summary about the project: what and why are you making this; what are the technical things being used. This description can be same as the README file in the repo (see below for instructions).

This project created allows any user to create and reserve vacation rooms. Essentially this software application is a miniature AirBnB app.

I wanted to make this project in particular because it will challenge my understanding of using JavaFX alongside using a database to store information that is needed to be stored.

Knowledge of SQL statements (creating tables and views, querying from tables), SQLiteJDBC (used to create the sqllite connection), and the javaFX(UI design) library were needed to construct this application.

See master branch for the code!
